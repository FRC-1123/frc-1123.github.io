### History
FRC Team 1123, AIM Robotics, was founded in 2003 by a group of home school families who desired to give their students an educational experience of a life time. Thus, we pride ourselves in accepting students of all ages, all education levels, and all experience levels. Unlike some teams that attend only set events every year, we make ourselves open to many possibilities. In our last eight years of attending regional competitions, we have gone to the VCU/NASA Richmond Regional three times, the Annapolis Regional three times, and the DC Regional two times. We also go to a multitude of off season competitions, including the Maryland state fair, the York, the Pennsylvania Summer Frenzy (hosted by team 225), and all of the Robot Rumbles in the Virginia State Fair since its inception in 2006.

### Strengths
One of the strengths of Team 1123 is the independence it has for being un-affiliated with a specific school. As a team that accepts any and all students who want to join, it is a team that prides itself with having students who have a variety of interests. This translates into new and innovative ideas for accomplishing the FRC challenges. The ROCKWELL AUTOMATION INNOVATION IN CONTROL AWARD shows that this strategy is working for Team 1123.

### Goals
The student members of AIM robotics are dedicated to learning. This means students can get involved in whatever they are interested in, rather than being assigned to a particular area or being confined to a specific topic. We also want to build a successful robot that will perform well during the regional competition. Therefore, our ultimate team goal is for our veteran members to help our rookie members get acclimated to the FIRST climate by giving them experience that will allow them to take control in the following years.
